# Geometric-Object-Area-Perimeter-Calculator
This project is part of my Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course at college. 
It outlines the requirements for the project and highlights my contributions and the tasks I performed throughout the process.
Requirements : 
Using the class named geometric object in your book start a graphical user
interface project for calculating the area and the perimeter of some
geometric objects like circles, rectangles, and squares.
You have to make your graphical user interface contain the following
items:
1. Combobox that contains the items you will calculate the area and
the parameter for them.
2. Text fields to enter they needed data for every geometric
object for example if you select a rectangle you have to fill in the
width and the height of this rectangle also if you select a circle
you have to fill in the radius for the circle.
3. A button named calculate and display that will calculate and
display the area and the parameter of this selected shape.
4. A label where these values will be displayed.
